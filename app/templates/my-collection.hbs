      <h1>PRINT & BURN</h1>
      <h3>COMING SOON</h3>
      <p>When you own a token representing digital art, you have the option to "Print & Burn".  This will allow you to create a physical edition of the artwork, framed and printed at museum-quality and shipped directly to you.</p>
      <p>By placing an order to print a physical edition of your artwork, you'll initiate a 'burn' of your token.  This means that you will no longer own the digital copy and will no longer be able to sell or transfer the digital edition on the Hyro Marketplace.</p>
