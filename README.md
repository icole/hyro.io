# hyro.io

Digital art gallery to display, purchase and sell art pieces as Ethereum ERC-721 NFT tokens . 

The genesis of this project was a 2018 MVP demo developed for a contracting client ([original demo](https://demo.hyro.io/)), but it unfortunately lost momentum and didn't end up making to main net. After the client signed over the IP, I decided to rebuild it somewhat from scratch using more up to date patterns and tech stack.

The front end was developed in Ember.js which doesn't have as much representation in the Web3 space, so I wanted to maintain a reference project for myself and potentially for others to benefit from.

# TODO items

- [X] Move over previous ERC-721 contracts
