# hyro.io

Hyro.io was an early attempt at a digital art gallery to display, purchase and sell art pieces as ERC-721 NFT tokens ([original demo](https://demo.hyro.io/)). The project was originally developed in 2018 in a private repository but never ended up making it to main net. I have decided instead to convert it to a public repository that can serve as an example to myself and anyone else interested in the space. The frontend was developed in Ember.js which doesn't seem to be utilized by many Web3 projects, so I hoped maybe it could serve as an example of a Web3 app written in Ember.js. It is currently under active development as I try to clean up the old code and move it.

# TODO items
- [ ] Move over previous API to Mirage
- [X] Move over previous ERC-721 contracts
- [ ] Update Ember.js to Octane
- [ ] Update Solidity version for contracts
- [ ] Move ERC-721 library to latest standard (OpenZeppelin?)
